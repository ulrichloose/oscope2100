Not really a fork,

here is my work that ist based nearly 100% on oscope2100. I own a similar old scope named DSO-220 USB and that is
technically mostly the same as the DSO2100. It is used universally on MAC OSX up to 10.14. The changes include a
wider time/dev from 5nS to 500mS and the elemination of the calculation section.

May be it ist useful for the other guys who own such an old usb scope (;-)
