Not really a fork,

here is my work that ist based nearly 100% on oscope2100. I own a similar old scope named DSO-220 USB and that is
technically mostly the same as the DSO2100. It is used universally on MAC OSX up to 10.14. The changes include a
wider time/dev from 5nS to 500mS and the elemination of the calculation section.

All the needed GTK2 USB etc. extensions must be installed via Homebrew and the rest is the same as on any Linux System.

May be it is useful for the other guys who own such an old usb scope (;-)
